# GOAL

* Educational implementation of SCP, starting with federated voting. 
* Provide clear implementations, optimized for readability and learning. 
* Event driven to allow for different gui visualizations (text, graph,...)
* Undo redo functionality
* Scenario create and replay

## Federated voting
Federated voting is a crucial part of the Stellar Consensus Protocol. 
It allows a set of nodes in FBAS system to agree on values. 

This library will implement the algorithm and also provide an overlay simulation, to see the impacts of network configuration/outtages/... on the Algorithms.

TODO: system state vs node state
