# GOAL

* Educational implementation of SCP, starting with federated voting. 
* Provide clear implementations, optimized for readability and learning.
* Event driven to allow for different gui visualizations (text, graph,...)
* Undo redo functionality
* Scenario create and replay
* Doesn't take quorum discovery into account for simplicity. All quorum slices for every node are known beforehand.
* Single slot consensus for simplicity
* Ignores security for simplicity (Message signing could be added in the future as it is an important part in why the algorithm works)

Current status = braindump, needs to be improved

# Install

## Federated voting
Federated voting is a crucial part of the Stellar Consensus Protocol. 
It allows a set of nodes in FBAS system to agree on values. 

This library will implement the algorithm and also provide an overlay simulation, to see the impacts of network configuration/outtages/... on the Algorithms.

TODO: system state vs node state

### Definitions
Quorum slice: A node trusts other nodes through its quorum slices. It defines sets of nodes (slices) that it will agree with. TODO: improve
Quorum: A set of nodes form a quorum, if every node has a quorum slice in this set of nodes. Meaning every node in the set will be convinced of a statement by the nodes in the set. TODO: improve 
Quorum intersection:
Intact Node: 
Befauled Node: 

### Federated voting 

First we discuss issues with voting in general. Let's assume we have a set of nodes that want to agree on a statement (e.g. a set of transactions to apply to ledger x). 
But where do we start? There is no 'leader' node, every node is equal and can vote for any statement they deem valid.   
Thus it is very easy to have a 'split vote'. No majority is possible because there are too many different votes. 
To solve this, a node cannot simply vote for another statement, contradicting it's previous vote. For example the node the node cannot simply vote to apply a different transaction set to ledger x.  
Other nodes could do the same thing and chaos would erupt with constant vote changing, never (consistently) reaching a majority. 
Also nodes could reach consensus on an 'old' vote, not knowing that a node already changed its mind!
Thus if nodes can't change their vote, we could have a split vote. 
However we could also have the scenario where there is a majority of nodes that agree, but another intact node cannot join the consensus, because it voted for another statement!

The problem we have to solve is that a statement that is voted on could get STUCK because nodes cannot vote again for contradictory statements. 
This means no consensus can be reached on the statement. 

For example. If nodes vote for the statement: The value of ledger 200 is x. 
If this statement would get stuck, we would never be able to reach consensus on the value of ledger 200 because nodes cannot vote for contradictory statements.
e.g. 'The value of ledger 200 is y'

To solve this we have to craft the statements we vote on carefully, to be able to allow for
1) neutralization of statements. Obsoleting a stuck statement. A neutralizable statement cannot (should not) block progress if stuck. 
2) irrefutable statements. If a statement cannot be voted against, it will never get stuck. Eventually everyone will agree. There is no statement that could contradict this statement.   

Federated voting:
In an FBAS we deal with quorums (see FBAS blogpost). If we find a quorum that agrees on a statement in an FBAS with quorum intersection no other quorum will disagree. 

Because voters can vote for any valid statement, a vote has three possible outcomes. Either the nodes agree on a statement, they agree on another incompatible statement, or there is no agreement at all. 

When a group of nodes reach consensus, another node v could get stuck if
* v or nodes in v's slices have voted for contradictory statements.
* some nodes that voted for the statement crashed afterwards and the node doesn't hear about the votes. (TODO: scenario) 

The only way for a node to know that a statemtent could be acted upon, is if it ratifies the statement first hand. Meaning that it observed a quorum ratify that statement AND that it is a part of that quorum.

To solve this we perform two votes!
The node votes for a statement and tries to accept that statement (or another one accepted by a blocking set)
The node votes that an intact node accepted that statement and tries to ratify that statement. 
TODO: wording needs work.

Federated voting  
##### Voting for a statement
A node only votes for statement if it is valid and consistent with all statements v has accepted (?TODO wording correct? is accepting here confusing?) and it has never voted against it in the past. The node also promises it will never vote against the statement in the future(i.e. contradict it).

TODO: explicit difference between there is a split vote and an intact node cannot reach consensus even though some nodes did.

Definitions:
* A quorum RATIFIES a statement if every member votes for it.
* A node RATIFIES a statement if it is a member of a quorum that ratifies that statement. (First hand ratification)
* In an FBAS with quorum intersection, two contradictory statements can never be ratified! Thus intact nodes (TODO definition intact) can never ratify contradicting statements. 

##### Accepting a statement 
* a node accepts a statement if a V-blocking set has ACCEPTED that statement OR if a quorum where the node is a member of has accepted or voted for this statement (RATIFIED)
* This allows a node to vote for a statement, and later accept a different statement.
* Two intact nodes can never accept contradictory statements.

However two issues still persist:
1) Weakened safety due to accepting statements of V-blocking sets. TODO: example
2) There is still no guarantee that all intact nodes can accept the statement. They could be stuck on different statements. TODO: wording

##### Confirming a statement (holding a vote on the fact that the first vote succeeded)
* Vote on an irrefutable statement. e.g. vote that an intact node has accepted the statement. TODO example
* Only confirm when the statement is RATIFIED.

The ratifying property solves the safety issues.
(TODO: Improve this) The irrefutable statement solves the issue that nodes could get stuck. If a quorum ratifies an irrefutable statement that is valid, and the node is part of that quorum, it confirms that statement. i.e. it can change its vote 

#### Why is federated voting not enough for concensus?
It is possible that no vote will ever get 'accepted' and the system will be stuck.
SCP is a protocol that uses federated voting and avoids STUCK states.
#### V-blocking 
A set of nodes is v-blocking for a node, if the set overlaps every one of its slices.
